# Base64 API Image Viewer
A simple way to view the base64 images that are sent via api using html + js.

## Setup
 Markup : 
 
          * Set the 'apiUrl' variable to a request url that sends a base64 encoded image.
 
          * Also, don't forget to change the format in 'imageElement.src' to a different one if you are not using webp.
